Monoid Automata Factory
=======================

This is the monoid automata factory (maf) originally by Alun Williams.
Alun's code is available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/maffsa. I
simply took his repository and checked the code into a git repository.

This is my TODO right now:
 * First I will add a Makefile to build MAF on Unix-Based systems
 * I will add tests
 * I will make it an option to use MAF instead of the original kbmag
   code in the [kbmag GAP package](https://github.com/gap-packages/kbmag)
 * I will reorganise the sources a bit
 * Since I am interested in automatic groups, I will work on some code
   relating to automatic groups, this might happen within MAF or as code
   to be discovered here.
